The Model class that exists in the current code doesn't contain all the data or methods that will be needed to perfom an A* search, 
so we are going to extend that class with a RouteModel class. In this exercise, you will fill out the RouteModel class in route_model.h. 
In the next exercises, you will also fill out the RouteModel::Node class as well.

To complete this exercise:
In route_model.h:

Add a private vector of Node objects named m_Nodes. This will store all of the nodes from the Open Street Map data.
Add a public "getter" method SNodes. This method should return a reference to the vector of Nodes stored as m_Nodes.
