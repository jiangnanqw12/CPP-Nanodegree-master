==============
Step1: Install IO2D
==============
Build/put io2d anaywhere you like

Follow from the github: https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl/blob/master/BUILDING.md
Section:Cairo/Xlib on Linux



CMake script expects cairo and graphicsmagick to be installed. libpng is required in order to run tests. These installation steps assume APT package manager on Ubuntu Linux. Installation steps:

	Refresh apt: sudo apt update
	Install GCC: sudo apt install build-essential

	**********************************
	* Don't install cmake from apt cmd
	**********************************
	X Install CMake: sudo apt install cmake => Please use 3.13.4, don't install from sudo apt...


		https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/tag/v3.13.4, download the source code and extract it.


		Run command from : https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake

		$ ./bootstrap && make && sudo make install
		=>open new terminal to get new cmake config, then keep doing the following cmds



	Install Cairo: sudo apt install libcairo2-dev
	Install graphicsmagick: sudo apt install libgraphicsmagick1-dev
	Install libpng: sudo apt install libpng-dev


Example of CMake execution:

	git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl
	cd P0267_RefImpl
	mkdir Debug
	cd Debug
	cmake --config Debug "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" ..
	cmake --build .


Build and install: still under Debug folder

	make
	sudo make install




==============
Step2: Build ND project
==============

Check the info from : https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project

1. git clone https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project.git --recurse-submodules

=> cd to the folder CppND-Route-Planning-Project
2. mkdir build && cd build
3. cmake ..

Those commands will build the code with the tests for the "Fill Out Route Model" exercise. The tests can then be run from the build directory as follows:

../bin/test




Exercise Name			-DTESTING String Value
Fill Out Route Model		"RouteModel"
Fill Out Node Class		"RMNodeClass"
Create RouteModel Nodes		"RMSNodes"
Write the Distance Function	"NodeDist"
Create Road to Node Hashmap	"NodeToRoad"
Write FindNeighbors		"FindNeighbors"
Find the Closest Node		"FindClosest"
Write the A* Search Stub	"AStarStub"
Finish A* Search		"AStarSearch"
