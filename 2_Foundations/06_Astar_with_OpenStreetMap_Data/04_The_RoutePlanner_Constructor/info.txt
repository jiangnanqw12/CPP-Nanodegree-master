The RoutePlanner Constructor
Now that you have filled out the header of the RoutePlanner class,
you can finish writing the constructor in route_planner.cpp.

The constructor takes one RouteModel reference and four floats as arguments.
The RouteModel reference should have been assigned to the m_Model variable in the previous exercise.
In this exercise, the floats should be used to construct the start_node and end_node of your class.
Since node coordinates are scaled to values 'between 0 an 1', you will need to scale the
floats as well in the constructor. See the instructions below for the steps on how to do this.

To complete this exercise:
Within the body of the RoutePlanner constructor:
    a.Scale the floats to percentages by multiplying each float by 0.01 and storing
        the result in the float variable. For example: start_x *= 0.01;
    b.Use the m_Model.FindClosestNode method to find the closest nodes to (start_x, start_y)
        and (end_x, end_y). Store pointers to these nodes in the start_node and end_node class variables.
