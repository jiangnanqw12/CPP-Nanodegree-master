Complete A* Search
In this exercise, you will complete AStarSearch() in route_planner.cpp using the NextNode,
ConstructFinalPath, and AddNeighbors methods you have written previously.

To complete this exercise:
    1.Delete the current contents of AStarSearch.
    2.Use the NextNode, ConstructFinalPath and AddNeighbors methods
    to implement the pseudocode below in AStarSearch:


Pseudocode
AStarSearch:
    1.Set start_node->visited to be true.
    2.Push start_node to the back of open_list.
    3.Create a pointer RouteModel::Node *current_node and initialize the pointer to nullptr.
    4.while the open_list size is greater than 0:
        a.Set the current_node pointer to the results of calling NextNode.
        b.if the distance from current_node to the end_node is 0:
            b.1 Call ConstructFinalPath using current_node and set m_Model.path with the results.
            b.2 Return to exit the A* search.
        3.else call AddNeighbors with the current_node.
