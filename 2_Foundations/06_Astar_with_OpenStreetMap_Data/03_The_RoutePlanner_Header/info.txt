The RoutePlanner Header
You are now read to begin filling out the RoutePlanner class, which will contain methods and data
to perform the A* search on the RouteModel data.

A class stub and empty class constructor have been provided in
the route_planner.h and route_planner.cpp files. You will be
starting with the header file route_planner.h.

Note that RoutePlanner already
has the private RouteModel reference m_Model.
This will refer to the model that you will be performing A* search on.

=> m_Model 是主要來做A* 的object


To complete this exercise:
1.Add the following private variables to the RoutePlanner class in route_planer.h:
    a.RouteModel::Node pointers "start_node" and "end_node".
        These will point to the nodes in
        the model which are closest to our starting and ending points.
    b.A float distance. This variable will hold the total distance for the route that
        A* search finds from start_node to end_node.

2.Add the following public method to the RoutePlanner class in route_planner.h:
    A GetDistance() method. This is a public getter method for the distance variable,
    and should just return distance. This method will later be
    used to print out the total distance from main.cpp.


    Note: This exercise has no tests associated with it, but there will
    be tests in future exercises using the RoutePlanner class.
